# Calendar due date template

> note you must have the dataview plugin enabled for this to work.

The template content itself is located at  [[duedate_worklog_dataheader]].

You can add it to the periodic note template as well and it will look for any notes in \_Worklog that are named with a string tagged "Due: MM-DD". worklog notes also include the year by default, but the search only looks for partial matches.
If you are concerned about multiple year results showing up, you should move your older notes into a different folder inside your worklog (or outside of the vault completely.)

If you hover over a result, a preview of the note link appears which can help to jog your memory.

If there are no due tags on a given date note, then the result will show as "0 results found"
